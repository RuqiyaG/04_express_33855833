# 04_express_33855833
 A web application using express with different routes showing contact information, about page and the main page.
 I started by initialising a node project by using npm init and then installed express and accessed its modules by importing.
 To start this application locally you need to open up the terminal and input node index.js and the console should tell you its running on localhost:800
 To view it on the virtual server/online just head over to my links file and click the links.
